# Purpose of admiralci

This repository contains GitHub Actions continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows, most of which are used by [`admiral`](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral) and its extensions.
Workflows defined here are responsible for assuring high package quality standards without compromising performance, security, or reproducibility.

Please refer to the [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows) directory to view the source code for the GitHub Actions workflows.

Notes :

- Some workflows are using github actions from [InsightsEngineering](https://github.com/insightsengineering/) group.
<!-- - Most of the workflows tends to be use by other packages (`oak` package for example). A global repository at Pharmaverse organization level will be set-up to host all common workflows for pharmaverse packages (Beyond Admiral uses cases).
This package will then probably be replaced by this global Pharmaverse repository in the future. -->
- Most of the workflows are sharing the same steps (see [Common workflows structure](common_structure.html)) (boilerplate code)
