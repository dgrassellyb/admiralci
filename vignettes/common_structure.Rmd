# Common structure of the workflows

## R-version input

For most of the workflows, we need to select a specific R version to load the associated `renv` profile.
That's why most of the actions have a `r-version` input (by default set-up to `4.1`) :

```
inputs:
    r-version:
    description: 'The version of R to use'
    default: '4.1'
    required: false
    type: string
```

## Use of `admiralci` docker images

Once the `r-version` is picked, the worfklows will run inside a docker container instance. Indeed, `admiralci` contains an action `push-docker-image`, to be able to build `rocker:rstudio` images
for each available version of `R` (versions specified in `renv/profiles`, see [renv profiles conf](get_started.html#renv-profiles-configuration-handling-several-r-versions)). 
At the building step of these docker images, every dependencies specified in the `renv.lock` files are installed.
A total of 4 images are created :

- `admiralci-4.1`
- `admiralci-4.2`
- `admiralci-4.3`
- `admiralci-devel`

These images and store them in admiralci ghcr (Github Container Registry - Place to store docker images), and are then reused to execute the workflows in docker container instances like this :

```
container:
    image: "ghcr.io/pharmaverse/admiralci-${{ inputs.r-version }}:latest"
```

(More more details on docker images creation process and how they're used, please read [Docker images and codespaces](docker_and_codespaces.html)) section.

## Checkout repository

This action is used to checkout on the right repository. This is a step commonly used in github actions to be able to access a repository tree.

```
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

## Staged dependencies

The staged dependencies action allow to install every necessary upstream dependencies for `admiral` package, suche as :
- `pharmaversesdtm` (SDTM test data)
- `admiraldev` (utilities functions for the Admiral package family)

(note that these dependencies are refered inside `staged_dependencies.yml` file)

For more details about staged.dependencies, please visit these links :

- [Staged Dependencies Package](https://github.com/openpharma/staged.dependencies)
- [Staged Dependencies Action](https://github.com/insightsengineering/staged-dependencies-action) (Github action to use Staged Dependencies package through github workflows)

```
- name: Run Staged dependencies
    uses: insightsengineering/staged-dependencies-action@v1
    with:
        run-system-dependencies: false
        renv-restore: false
    env:
        GITHUB_PAT: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Note : the user can specify some parameters depending on the use case :
- run-system-dependencies : install or not sys dependencies
- renv-restore : restore or not renv.lock dependencies
(and many other options you can find on Staged Dependencies Action documentation).
